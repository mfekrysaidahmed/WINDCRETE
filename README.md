# WINDCRETE
[WINDCRETE](https://corewind.eu/wp-content/uploads/files/publications/COREWIND-public-design-and-FAST-models-of-the-two-15mw-floater-turbine-concepts.pdf) is a spar platform of the IEA15MW wind turbine. WINDCRETE is part of the [COREWIND H2020 project](https://zenodo.org/records/4322446), which aims to design a floating platform for IEA15MW. This repo is only an upgrade of the original WINDCRETE  OpenFAST model from v2.1 to v3.5.4.
